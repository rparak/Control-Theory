# Control-Theory

# Control Theory I (VA1):
The introduction to the classical control theory is presented in the course. We focus on linear time-invariant systems (LTI) without delay with one degree of freedom in the transfer form and on the synthesis of PID controllers. The interpretation is demonstrated through the illustrations from different application areas. Synthesis of control systems can be easily carried out with the use of Matlab Control System Toolbox.
